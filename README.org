* entr-runner.el

A complete hot reload package that let you choose the command you want and can watch multiple files.

** ❓ Why?

I was coding a website with thymeleaf on springboot but I wasn't able to make the hotreload functionality to work properly for me. (Skill issues I know)
That lead me to this package. It permits to choose one or multiple files/directories or both then write a custom command that will run each time these files are changed.
