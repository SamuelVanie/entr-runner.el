;; Author: Samuel Michael Vani√©
;; Version: 1.0
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "25.1"))
;; Keywords: convenience, files
;; URL: https://github.com/SamuelVanie/entr-runner

;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a convenient way to do hotreload using entr on the files
;; or directories marked
;; in Dired or specified by a regex, with user-friendly options.
